POLYNOMIAL LINEAR REGRESSION
 y= b0 + b1x1 + b1x1^2 +....+bnxn^n
 

we have the same variable but with different powers 


->there are certain types of distribution where a linear regreesion might not fit well 
- according to the different use cases we would be using different regression algorithms in order to have the most accurate predict 


why are we still calling it linear regression? 
- in here we are not considering the linearity in mathematical terms but we are focusing on the linear combination of the coefficients (b0, b1...bn) which are still yet to be known .

let's say we are thinking of hiring a person who was a region manager and he expects some salary . 
how using this dataset we build a model and predict the salary of the region manager and compare it with how much he is expecting
