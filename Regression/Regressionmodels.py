'''
simple linear regression ***

y^ = b0+b1X1
y^ is dependent variable 
 b0 is the y intercept and is constant 
 b1 is the slope coefficient 
 X1 is the independent variable 
 
 
 -> we can plot a scatterplot between the dependent variable vs the independent one 
 
  => There can be multiple lines that can be drawn using the points with different slops 
     To find the best fit line we use something called ordinary least square method 
     
     -> we draw straight vertical lines from the points onto the line and compare the y values .

     The one for which (yi-yi^)^2 is minimised is the best fit line
