'''
There are two types of parameters - 
1) The model itself learns and do change at times (are learned by the model )
2) The parameters we decide for the model (like the kernel parameter of svm )- hyperparameter 
 - now these parameters are not learned by the model . 
 - we need to optimise the model by tuning these parameters 
 
We will be doing hyperparameter tuning using grid search
