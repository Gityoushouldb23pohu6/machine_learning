LOGISTIC REGRESSION : 
    predict a categorical dependent variable from a number of independent variables 
    
    
    The y values in the shown scenario is either yes or no . 
    
    ////eqn of logistic regression 
    
    the curve of logistic regression is sigmoid 
    now ,whenever we are checking whether its a yes or no condition for two x values we will be essentially checking the probability of these x values 
    
    we are also drawing a middle line specifying the 50 percent probability 
    
    any thing above this line would be consideredd a yes and anything below would be considered a no 
    
    here ,  we can add various features now

MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD 

how do we know if the given curve is the best fitting curve for our data 

we would multiply the p values for some points in our curve with the (1-p) values of those points in the same curve  -> Likelihood 
 
we look for different curves the one having the maximum likelihood and thus the one obtained is used for regression
