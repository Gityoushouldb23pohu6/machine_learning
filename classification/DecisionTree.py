DECISION TREE CLASSIFICATION : 
    
    in here we use various splits to split our data points into parts 
    
    
    the split is made so as to maximise either the number of greens or number of reds in a partition .
    
    
    now we construct a decision tree 
    
    the terminal leaves always classify our data 

-> these are old methods 
- reborn with upgrades --- random forest ,gradient boosting etcs
